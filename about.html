        I am a rising second-year graduate candidate at the Lunar and Planetary Lab (LPL), UArizona. I work with the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) science team, and I am in charge of developing and refining thermal models capable of physically characterizing asteroids.

        I am also an Effective Altruism movement builder, and I run the student group Tucson Effective Altruism (TEA). Interests in this space include (farm and wild) animal welfare, space governance, and AI safety.
